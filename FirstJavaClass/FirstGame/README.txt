This is a small Game that I made in my first ever Java course. The idea was to learn and reinforce our understanding of everything we learned up to that point in the semester
which was Classes, Variables, APIs, Methods, Fundamentals of Objects, Conditional statements, Loops, and Print Statements The game is about an exploring space man crashing your rover on mars. 
You have to get to the space station by managing your character.

Hello and welcome to the Mars management/survival game!

In this game, you play as a terraforming engineer working for a mega-corporation in the year 2077. Your rover gets destroyed in an unkown accident, and you lose communication with your fellow engineers. It is up to you to 
get back to the station safely by managing your hunger, your suit and your oxygen levels and making sure you don't run out of any of the crucial supplies associated with each of these stats. 

To compile, just compile all of the java files in the folder by using "javac *.java" in the console while inside of the folder the files are contained in. To play, run Mars.java and the game will begin.

IMPORTANT: Play with the console in full screen to see the graphics. Also, the graphics were made using the website https://www.text-image.com/ using pictures gotten off of Google images.

BUGS: No bugs known about.
