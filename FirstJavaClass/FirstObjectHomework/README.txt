This was homework demostrates our knowledge of objects, and inheritance. We also wrote JUnit tests for the classes we created. 
We were given the Point2D code.

TO COMPILE: Open your console, change directories to where the .java files are stored, then type in your console "javac *.java"
There might be a message saying that there are unsafe or unchecked methods but the files work just fine.

TO TEST: Type in "java org.junit.runner.JUnitCore (Name of test class here)" to run the tests.
